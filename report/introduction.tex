\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The internet is a vital tool, that is almost a necessity in a significant portion of the world today. It is responsible for bringing together disparate and heterogenous societies under the common roof of a networked world. In today's world, life without internet seems almost impossible to large sections of the human population. In such a scenario, it is unfortunate and seemingly unfair that certain areas be left out of this global and fast-paced revolution, solely because of their geographical location. It is sadly a very common happening, that rural and remotely located areas have limited or no access to high speed internet. This is due to a multitude of fcators such as inability to set up the infrastructure required for internet in hostile terrains and environments, hesitation of service providers due to sparseness of population and possible lack of profit, and general concerns of people who haven't been exposed to wireless internet technologies previously and might have some apprehensions about its impact on their society. Through this project, we aim to better understand the perceptions and concerns of residents in the Mendocino county of California, U.S.A, and analyze a broad set of issues that people might have about the infiltration of broadband in their society. We also aim to create and in future, distribute a comprehensive educational material that would aid the residents in better understanding the internet technology, and its beneficial usage.

As Yahel can attest, many users of FurtherReach wish to gain a better
understanding of the networkâ€™s technology and operational practices. Addressing
their questions has the potential to bring them both short term benefits
(e.g. satiating their curiosity, lowering operational costs for FurtherReach)
and long term benefits (e.g. enabling the community to sustain the network on
their own).
