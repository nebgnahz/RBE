\section{Lessons Learned}
\label{sec:lessons}

Lessons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It's difficult to conduct interviews in a non-biased way. Many of our
questions did not do a great job at getting the interviewee to actually talk
about their perceptions without our influence.
\item Sampling bias was pervasive in our interviews; most of our
interviewees were pro-broadband, and we didn't manage to find any `tin-hats`
or people who couldn't afford broadband. It's difficult to
get ahold of the right people!
\item We have come to believe that our educational materials will be more
useful as a {\em reference} for anyone who comes to Further Reach with
questions, rather than as an vector for convincing anyone to sign up.
