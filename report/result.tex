  payment. Don't know how to pay online.
\item Subscription Requests. Many asking for the service. Some offer new relay
  sites or act as local tech volunteer. % though locations aren't good
\item Quality of Service. Best way to do a SpeedTest. Some complain that they
  are not getting the service they're paying for.
\item Troubleshooting. Antenna not installed? System down? Many people call
  about the internet being down. Give a list of possible reasons why the
  internet could be down (such as a power outage, which will cause the internet
  to go off even if they have battery back-up in their house)
\item Concerns. ATT wireless home phone interference?
\item Request unusual features. Static IP (web service, VPN whitelist)? email
  service (port 25)? uPnP service?

\item Password Related. Providing SSID/password of their network and hoping
  technician solve the connection issue I have forgotten my password for
  connecting to the internet at Irish.
\item Price. Non-profits want free access. People asking for vacation pricing.
