# Motivation

During the trip, local residents showed interest in knowing the key technolgies
behind the network. They raised questions like "What is PoE?", "Why is
point-to-point communication used but not wireless mesh?", etc.

As Computer Science students working on networking, we are able to answer these
questions to a certain extent; and we can probably do a better job if we can
lookup the literature and synthesize before we answer. However for non-CS
people, they might need to dive into a few hundred-of-page book and spend
extensive amount of time online before they could answer some simple questions.

This gap between the curiousity and the organization of knowledge motivates our
attempt to work on this rural broadband education project.

# Targeted Audience and Goals:

1. New Broadband Volunteer (for documentation and rapid replication)
2. Local residents (sustainability, low operational cost)

# Possible Outcomes

1. Survey and field study about the demand of such knowledge
2. A collection of FAQs that could provide the knowledge base for rural broadband.
3. Some easy to understand visualization or demonstration of network
   technologies to normal people.

# Misc
Side notes from Colin:

Random thought: in addition to explaining how the technology works, we might
also consider a side project of explaining the (lack of) health issues
associated with RF technologies. This is to address the so-called "Tin Hats"
that were mentioned several times on our field trip.
