# Motivation

As Yahel can attest, many users of FurtherReach wish to gain a better
understanding of the network’s technology and operational practices. Addressing
their questions has the potential to bring them both short term benefits
(e.g. satiating their curiosity, lowering operational costs for FurtherReach)
and long term benefits (e.g. enabling the community to sustain the network on
their own).

# Research Question

By providing users with educational materials (of some not-yet-decided form),
can we measurably improve users’ understanding?

# Targeted Audiences

- Local residents (sustainability, lower operational costs)
- (Possibly:) Network operators (facilitating replication of organizations
  similar to FurtherReach)

# Work Plan

1. Ask Yahel: what are the most commonly asked questions from users?
2. Use the results of step 1 to develop a survey. The survey serves two purposes: (i) gaining a better understanding of what users would like to understand, and (ii) measuring users’ understanding prior to our educational intervention.
3. Develop a plan for distributing the survey, considering how we might address sampling bias, how we might maximize participation, etc.
4. Travel to Mendocino, and distribute the survey (details undecided).
5. Develop educational materials, focused around the issues discovered from step 4.
6. Develop a plan for distributing the educational materials. Same considerations as step 3.
7. Distribute the educational materials, considering how we might measure whether users are actively engaging with the materials.
8. Develop a second survey designed to measure educational outcomes.
9. Distribute the second survey, and compare the results with those from step 4.
10. Profit.

# Considerations

Not clear that we’re going to be able to achieve this in two months. Are we
simply trying to improve understanding, or are we also trying to improve users’
skills? A user’s desire to know how to fix something will be greatly increased
once something breaks, but the network probably won’t break in the next two
months. Perhaps we should focus on the more modest goal of improving
understanding.  Are there going to be enough opportunities for us to travel to
Mendocino?

# Possible Educational Materials

A collection of FAQs (online, or offline) that could provide the knowledge base
for rural broadband.  Some easy to understand visualization or demonstration of
network technologies to normal people.  Information sessions (e.g. giving a
lecture)

# Misc

In addition to explaining how the technology works, we might also consider a
side project of explaining the (lack of) health issues associated with RF
technologies. This is to address the so-called "Tin Hats" that were mentioned
several times on our field trip.
